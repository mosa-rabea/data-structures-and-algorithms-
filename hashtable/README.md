# Hashtables

A Hashtable is an array of a list. Each list is known as a bucket, The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method, A Hashtable contains values based on the key. Java Hashtable class contains unique elements.

## Challenge

implement HashTable class with 4 methods (add , hash , get, contains).

## Approach & Efficiency

Time :O(n)
Space :O(n)
 because we used while loop and we use array.

## API

* get(): to check and return the value of the given key.

* contains: to check if the key exists in the hash table and returns a boolian acordingly.

* hash(): takes a key and convert it to an integer index.

* add(): to add a new key-value pair to the hash table.
